Papi Berlin is a group of active fathers\*. It is important to us to question role stereotypes and to redefine our role as fathers\*. Keywords such as [Mental-Load](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/) and needs-oriented parenting are important to us.

Do you have any questions about fatherhood, e.g. parental allowance, daycare, parenting? Then you are welcome to get in [contact](/contact) with us, we try to help everyone.

We have a very active [Slack channel](/pages/slack) where we exchange ideas, feel free to join.
