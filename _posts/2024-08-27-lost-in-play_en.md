At the beginning of this month, my kid asked me for a new game to play on her iPad. Luckily, I already knew
the perfect game for us to play together: [Lost in Play](https://www.happyjuice.games). I played a couple of minutes of it last month and
waited for my kid to tell me she wanted to play something.

Lost in Play is an amazing way to introduce kids to point-and-click adventures. You don't need to be able to
read; all characters use a fantasy language when talking, and you can skip hard puzzle sections. Together
with a near-perfect help system, this game was amazing for my 6-year-old. She could not put it away and was
eager to continue playing the next day.

After she finished the game with me, she completed it two more times on her own. I just needed to help with three
puzzles that, unfortunately, could not be skipped and were too hard for her.

This is easily a 5/5 game for our family. The first chapter can be played for free on the iOS store. The full version
is â‚¬6.99, and at that price, it's a steal. It has no loot boxes or ads.
