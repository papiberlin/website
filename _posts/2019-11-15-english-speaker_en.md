A lot of our members are expats. [Our
Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/dadaberlin/shared_invite/zt-1skuexk5x-OUzSHVwxWWayPUHYjNfiAA) has a very active English channel and on our meetups we try to include everyone. Just send
us an <a href="mailto:mail@papiberlin.de?subject=Slack&body=Slack invite">email</a> and
we will invite you to it.

We are no lawyers, but if you need some guidance in the German bureaucracy or
have questions regarding raising your kid, we might know the answer or at least
the right person to ask.

So please subscribe to our newsletter or join our slack. Alternatively, feel
free to [contact](/contact) us via the web form.
