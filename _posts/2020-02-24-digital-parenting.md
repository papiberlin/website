## Vor der Geburt

* Baby Berlin
  ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.gesundheitbb.clbirth),
  [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/baby-berlin-app/id976204677?l=en&mt=8)).
  This is the most important one if you are living in Berlin. It has a checklist
  what you need to do before and after the birth. It also has links and addresses
  for everything you need to do. Really good if you don’t want to get lost in the
  German bureaucracy. This app is also in English.
* [embryotox](https://www.embryotox.de/) to check if you can
  use certain medicine while pregnant.
* [Ovia Pregnancy App](https://www.ovuline.com/#ovia-pregnancy-app). There are
  several pregnancy tracker apps. I tried a couple of them and this is what I
  kept using. Nice articles about the current progress of your unborn.
* [Contraction Timer](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/labor-contraction-timer-birth/id1204868842?l=en&mt=8).
  You hopefully only need this app a couple of hours, but during those hours it
  is really helpful. It keeps track of the duration and interval of the
  contractions.

## Nach der Geburt

* White noise app (rain, waves etc). Babies love white noise to fall asleep.
  There are way to many apps to highlight one here. Just make sure that you get
  one with a wide variety of sounds. Some babies like rain, some a hair dryer.
  You never know till you tried it out. [Relax Meditations](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/relax-meditation-guided-mind/id367506176)
