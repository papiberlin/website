Coworking is the ideal working arrangement for many freelancers. But what happens when you also have a child? It can sometimes be challenging to meet all needs. Luckily, there are coworking spaces that specialize in exactly that â€“ with childcare. Sometimes flexible, sometimes a real kindergarten in the room next door. This way, the child is always nearby in case anything happens. This concept is also ideal for people who, during their parental leave, still need an office space one day a week to work on projects.

Perhaps the best part: all co-workers share the same everyday problems, leading to very intense conversations and friendships.

Curious? On [coworkingforparents.org](https://coworkingforparents.org/map), we've listed all coworking offices for parents. Maybe there's one near you?
