Finally, the moment has arrived! On January 12th, [ten new episodes](https://press.disneyplus.com/news/disney-plus-ten-all-new-bluey-episodes-coming-january-12-2024) of our absolute favorite series *Bluey* will be released on Disney+. This means not only 10 new adventures but also 10 moments that will touch our hearts and make us laugh.

If you haven't experienced *Bluey* yet, you're missing out on something amazing! This series accomplishes something unique – it appeals to both parents and children alike. I have never experienced so many emotions in a children's series like I have with *Bluey*. From heartwarming scenes to hearty laughter – this series has it all.

The story follows six-year-old Bluey, a playful Australian Cattle Dog, and her family. But it's much more than just an animated dog story. *Bluey* reflects real family life, and that's what makes it so special.

Bluey manages to convey important life lessons while not neglecting the fun. And yes, even for parents. The series is perfect for children aged 4 and up, and it will equally delight older children and adults.

So, grab your little ones, get cozy on the couch, and let the new *Bluey* episodes enchant you. It will be an emotional and entertaining journey for the whole family. Don't forget to have the tissues ready.
