We just brought our child to daycare for the first time, how can they be
starting school already ðŸ˜…?

It's crazy how time flies with kids sometimes. But to help you be somewhat
prepared for the school routine, here are a few links that really helped us:

1. The german book [Hallo
   Schulanfang!](https://www.genialokal.de/Produkt/Saskia-Niechzial/Hallo-Schulanfang_lid_49176235.html)
   alleviated many of our fears and provided a clear path of what we should/could
   do before school starts.
1. Our [School Kid List with 53 Gift Ideas for the School
   Cone](https://wishlephant.com/wishlists/b65082f9-8e86-475e-936d-9edd02b74e7a)
   ensured our little one had a fantastic first day with lots of joy unpacking the
   school cone.
1. We chose our daughter's school backpack at
   [Ranzenfee](https://ranzenfee-koffertroll.de/) in Berlin. Great advice, a
   wide selection. A very good buying experience for our little one.
1. Additionally, [Stiftung Warentest has a school backpack test from
   2019](https://www.test.de/Schulranzen-im-Test-1765493-0/)
1. You can find more links on learning in our [resource
   collection](/resourcen/learning).

Next month, two episodes of one of our favorite german parenting podcast ([Das
gewÃ¼nscheste Wunschkind](https://www.gewuenschtestes-wunschkind.de/)) will
publish two episodes on the topic of school:

1. [Episode 146 - Accompanying the Start of School in a Relationship-Oriented
   Manner (20.08.2024)](https://www.gewuenschtestes-wunschkind.de/2024/08/hallo-schulanfang-podcast-mir-saskia.html)
1. [Episode 147 - Getting Through Elementary School Together (03.09.2024)](https://www.gewuenschtestes-wunschkind.de/2024/09/miteinander-durch-die-grundschulzeit.html)
